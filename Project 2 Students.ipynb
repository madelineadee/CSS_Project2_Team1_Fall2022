    "Now, we will partition our data to prepare it for the training process. We will use 60% train—20% validation—20% test in this case. More data in the training set lowers bias, but then increases variance in the validation/test sets. Balancing between bias and variance with choice of these set sizes is important as we want to ensure that there is enough data to train on to get good predictions, but also want to make sure our hold-out sets are representative enough."
